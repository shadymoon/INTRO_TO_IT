      <h2 style="font-size:150%;">What is your interest in IT?</h2>

    <p style="font-size:130%;">Ever since I was a child I remember being surrounded by technology, I remembered when the theme song for Courage the Cowardly Dog , Codename: Kids Next Door  used to blare out during the middle of the night when the Cartoon Network channel used to be left on in the living room, I remembered when I was able to call my family members on a small Blackberry device when they were across the country wondering how it was possible. Those thoughts provoked me as I wanted to find answers, but my young mind could not comprehend and understand what I was taking in. Soon enough I found the Internet and learned the basics of how to use it, I was astonished how there were no limits on what I wanted to do, If I wanted to look at videos of certain animals it could be brought up in an instant, If I wanted to play games, there were countless flash game websites available to play on. Over time as I have grown older, I have been using the Internet almost daily. The thought of a career in IT did not seem like something I wanted to pursue until very recently. As recently as last year I had been stuck on what career I would like to pursue. At first, I wanted to apply and pursue a Bachelor of Psychology and become a psychologist as I wanted to explore the science of human behaviour and the mental states that drive it, alongside also being able to help the people closest to me. As time went on, I was very obsessed with media relating to true crime, so I thought of becoming a criminologist and pursuing a Bachelor of Criminology and Psychology, but due to my parent’s wishes, I decided it was not the right choice. My father recommended a Bachelor’s in IT, but I was very against it as the thought of programming, and troubleshooting all day felt boring to me, but as I did my research, I came to the realization of how important IT is to our daily lives, how everyday technology keeps evolving and how innovations keep pushing the limit of what mankind can achieve. I wanted to be an innovator, helping improve society and help make a change in the world, which is what led me to this course.

<h3 style="font-size:150%;">Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%;">After being recommended to attend Open University by a teacher I met prior, it opened a whole new gateway to learning for me. My original wishes were to finish my education and go to university, but finding out that with OUA, I was able to start early and learn remotely, helped create new levels of motivation inside me. With the help of my parents, we researched many different courses, subjects, degrees, and options and finally decided that the Bachelor of IT at RMIT University was the best choice suited for me. This course had a wide scope involving many information technologies and computer science concepts that seemed like a great foundation for a future career in the IT industry.</p>


<h4 style="font-size:150%;">What do you expect to learn during your studies? </h4>
<p style="font-size:130%;">During my time studying for the Bachelor of IT, I anticipate learning and gaining a deeper understanding of all sectors of IT, including the ability to improve my programming, communications, and networking as I delve deeper into this course. I expect to also learn lifelong skills and lessons from this course to help develop me as a well-rounded person in the IT space and help improve the quality of my life. </p>
