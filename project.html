      <h2 style="font-size:150%;">Overview</h2>

    <p style="font-size:130%;">The project I have chosen to create is an application and service that focuses on being a curated E-Commerce Marketplace that is designed to allow people to buy and sell items relating to fashion remotely and locally. This service will help fulfill people’s demand for certain pieces of fashion quickly and easily. The rise of social media has helped catapult different fashion brands to new levels of popularity, with the demand for these brands being relatively high, but the desired stock being low. In addition to being a standard online marketplace service, this application provides unique features that are unlike anything any other competitor has, however, are essential to the growing population of fashion lovers around the globe who want to be able to purchase their desired piece of clothing.
</p>

<h3 style="font-size:150%;">Motivation</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%;">My motivation for this project firstly stemmed from my love of Hip-Hop culture. Hip-Hop culture often glamourizes materialistic items to flaunt wealth, it may seem an arrogant and ignorant way of displaying their morals and personalities to people who are not interested in the music genre, however depending on who the artist is, the song mentioned, and the wordplay on the verse, it can create a whole new mood and piece of art for whoever is listening. Take for example rising underground Australian Hip-Hop artists Benshi and kyotosdesire, who often flaunts their wealth by using talking about how much money they have in their lyrics , from the outside looking in, it may seem as if these lyrics mean nothing, but in the context of their upbringing and experiences, it creates a form of art. As I listened to more songs and followed more artists the more, I got interested I was into clothing. Instead of viewing clothes as something I put on every day without a care, I viewed them more as an art, a way of being able to express yourself freely and be creative while also being able to connect with others, just like painting and drawing. I discovered online marketplaces so I could easily find pieces of clothing I desired and was able to negotiate them at a price that I could afford. As time went on, I soon realized how many features could be added to innovate different marketplaces to new heights, nonetheless of the many controversies and accusations that unauthentic pieces were being easily sold on their services whilst these companies swept those cases under the rug. I wanted to create an online marketplace with the best features to benefit anybody interested in clothing, while also being simplistic and efficient to use.</p>


<h2 style="font-size:150%;">Description</h2>
<p style="font-size:130%;">This application and service will have a user-friendly interface that can be accessed in a desktop or phone format. This application will be the perfect one-stop destination for consumers who are looking to buy or sell their favourite pieces of clothing in a used or brand-new condition. The application will have many different pages and tabs that take the user to different features of the service such as a filter where customers can find only a specific model or silhouette from a specific brand. The following are features with in-depth details of information about the feature.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;"><b>Optimized Buying/Selling Features:</b></p>

<p style="font-size:140%;">Buyer Protection / Verification process on shipping</p>
<p style="font-size:130%;">When users decide to purchase an item off the application, they will be tasked to choose if they would like to ship the item or pick it up depending on the locality of the item. If they decide to ship the item out, it will be transported to various authenticity-checking facilities available across the country. If the desired item turns out to be unauthentic, they will receive a full refund and the seller will be faced with precautions.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;"><em>Returns and Exchanges</em></p>
<p style="font-size:130%;">When an item is shipped, there can be many mishaps that could create damage or unwanted needs. Whether the postal service being used manage to damage or lose the package, it can tarnish the reputation of the app and can leave consumers empty-handed. An option to exchange or refund within a specific time can help benefit the application and the customer without any hassle. </p>

<p style="font-size:140%;"><em>Live Tracking Updates</em></p>
<p style="font-size:130%;">Many online marketplaces such as StockX, Goat, and Depop do not have live tracking updates within their apps but link an external source to provide shipment updates. A feature within the app that can exactly pinpoint and update the whereabouts of packages on a geographical scale, something like Shopify’s app tracking information system is a must-have when running an online marketplace.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;"><em>Seller Profile / Reviews</em></p>
<p style="font-size:130%;">The application will ask users to create a personalized profile, to provide a form of email verification and phone verification to indicate that this user is not an automated machine. This profile can be fully customizable, being able to add a theme, an about section, and much more. A user profile will also have reviews of customers who have previously bought from said users to help give new customers a sense of legitimacy about a certain seller alongside a messaging system in which a pickup option will be available.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;"><b><em>Unique Features:</em></b></p>


<p style="font-size:140%;"><em>Personalized Suggestions </em></p>
<p style="font-size:130%;">When viewing pages for specific silhouettes, there will be personalized suggestions that show popular alternatives to the one being shown, whether it is a different colorway, model, or completely new item, it can help give new ideas and become more effective in directing the user’s purchase choices.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;"><em>Community Images</em></p>
<p style="font-size:130%;">A community tab when viewing a page for a specific model will be available for users to freely upload photos of their outfits with the said item in it. Users will have the choice to upvote or downvote the photos to express their opinions about the outfits. A separate tab will also be available for photos of celebrities, and public figures who have worn the item where users will also have a choice to upvote or downvote the photos. These tabs are a great way for people to garner inspiration and ideas so they can add it to their personal style.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;"><em>Use of Augmented Reality</em></p>
<p style="font-size:130%;">A unique feature that has never been available on any marketplace platform is the use of augmented reality. On specific shoe models depending on the notoriety and current resell value of a brand new one, there will be an option to preview the shoe on the user’s foot before they make a purchase. This feature can be a helpful tool for people to help gain ideas for outfits.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;"><em>Pickup Option</em></p>
<p style="font-size:130%;">As stated before, a pickup option can be available for users who choose not to pay any fees. This option can be very convenient as users will not have to deal with the hassle of shipping – no late deliveries, or lost packages - and users will also have the flexibility of time when picking up. However, users do have to keep in mind safety precautions when choosing the option to pick up.</p>

<p style="font-size:140%;"><em>Visual Tutorial to Determine Authenticity </em></p>
<p style="font-size:130%;">The rise of replica apparel is growing bigger each day, as resell prices rise, people have turned to replica goods to satisfy their needs. Some individuals have resorted to selling these counterfeit items on different marketplace platforms to profit off unsuspecting buyers. To prevent this, a visual tutorial with step-by-step photos on how to properly self-authenticate items will be available on pages of certain pages for items, depending on the popularity and resell value. This will help educate buyers on what to look out for and help others in the community as well.</p>


<h2 style="font-size:150%;">Tools and Technologies</h2>
<p style="font-size:130%;">When developing this application and service, there will be several tools that need to be able to complete the creation. The following tools and technologies listed are elements that will be required:

UX Design – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all great programming languages for UX/UI.

</p>

<h2 style="font-size:150%;">Skills Required</h2>
<p style="font-size:130%;">To be able to successfully complete this project, multiple skills are necessary.
Firstly, to develop the application design, experience in the field of UX Design is necessary to create an aesthetically pleasing application whilst also keeping its simplicity.

</p>

<h2 style="font-size:150%;">Outcome </h2>
<p style="font-size:130%;">The successful development of this application and service will help create the perfect marketplace platform for fashionistas worldwide. This idea has helped fill all the needs that were missing among the top online marketplace platforms. The unique features of the application help differentiate it from other competitors while also having a sense of originality. Everyone should be able to afford whatever pieces of clothing they would like, from high-end designer brands to streetwear, or even non-branded pieces of clothing. There should be no hassle and barrier in helping people express themselves using outfits that reflect their personality and liking, which is why this project idea strives to provide this opportunity.</p>
