<p style="font-size:130%;">Hello, my name is Muhammad, and welcome to my profile.</p>
<p style="font-size:130%;">I was born in Jakarta, Indonesia in 2005 thus making me 16 years of age at the time of writing. Jakarta is the capital city of Indonesia with a population of around 10 million. It is located on the northwest coast of the Island of Java and has a deep historic mix of cultures – Javanese, Malay, Chinese, Arab, Indian, and European – that has influenced its language, cuisine, and architecture. I spent around 3 years of my life living there so there is barely anything I remember about my time overseas. When I turned 3 years old, my family decided to immigrate to Australia, where we decided to settle down in Sydney, New South Wales, which is where I currently reside.</p>
<p style="font-size:130%;">I completed all my education so far in Sydney, from K-8 in public schools and years 9-10 in homeschooling during the peak of the pandemic. After completing my Year 10 Certificate, I had many options to further complete my education, which is where I found Open University through a teacher I met a year prior.</p>
<p style="font-size:130%;">One of the main hobbies that I love to do is create some sort of content on the Internet. I grew up watching a lot of YouTube, playing a lot of games, and browsing the Internet. I consumed a lot of video media growing up and it inspired me to try to replicate what my favorite video creators were uploading, even if I were not able to access the same equipment as them. At 10 years old, I taught myself how to screen capture gameplay on my video game console and learned how to edit my clips on a free editing software I found online with YouTube video tutorials. The hours recording pointless gameplay, editing, and repeating the cycle repeatedly helped ignite a flame inside for creating content. Later in my schooling, I met friends who had the same common interest as me, which lead to a new passion for music creation, something that I enjoy producing to this day.
