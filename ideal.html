<h2 style="font-size:150%;">Position Description</h2>

    <p style="font-size:130%;">The position I have found for what my ideal job would be is a Software Engineer with Intermarc Global Private Limited. This position focuses on working with Executive, Product, Data, and Design teams to assist with technical issues and support their data infrastructure requirements. It also focuses to expand, develop, and modify existing programs as the need to meet the ever-changing business requirements and the practice of testing and debugging build software applications to guarantee they meet the business standard. This position focuses on what my end goal and achievements are in the IT Industry, which is to become a software engineer and help improve not only Australia, but society, and to also create a comfortable future for my family and future generations to come.

<h3 style="font-size:150%;">Position Skills and Qualifications</h3>
<p style="font-size:130%;">This position necessitates me to have a range of professional experience, as well as a high degree of education and geographical location. The following are more in-depth details of the qualifications for this position:</p>

<p style="font-size:130%;">•	Ability to commute/relocate to Ryde, NSW before starting work.</p>

<h4 style="font-size:150%;">Personal Skills and Qualifications</h4>
<p style="font-size:130%;">As being the age I am, I have very few qualifications for this role. The following are in-depth details of the qualifications that I can provide:</p>

<p style="font-size:130%;">•	Ability to commute/relocate to Ryde, NSW.</p>

<h5 style="font-size:150%;">Progression Plan</h5>
<p style="font-size:130%;">Due to having very few qualifications for this role, it is safe to say that I will have to embark on a 10-year journey of professionalism, development, and education. The journey to this position can be broken into three steps:</p>
